Welcome To SyncDesk Automatic Install Script

First things first

I Do NOT Own or am responsible for SynkDesk maintenance if there is a problem with the utility I am not usually the one that handles it
Please keep that in mind when using this script
I am purely creating a script to install it easily
It is my utmost priority to ensure you can install things and run commands as efficiently as posible

Now how to install the script 

1. Download the Script Via Github
2. cd into the directory with the script in
3. run chmod +x ./SyncDeskAIS.sh
4. Script installed run it with ./SyncDeskAIS.sh
5. The install script is now ready to use not using the sync desk is another thing and not part of this tutorial
